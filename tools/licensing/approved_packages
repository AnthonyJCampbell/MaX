# Custom ESLint plugin
# We've written a custom plugin for ESLint. This is kept as a mini-package within the codebase and
# is "installed", meaning it ends up in `package.json`. However it doesn't have or need a license
# so exculde it here

# HMW/TAL TODO
# This uses a Python license: https://github.com/nodeca/argparse
# TAL has been looking into this with legal for another package, but he is currently away. Blocking
# the merge of the Electron upgrade for a week for this reason only doesn't seem sensible, so allow
# it for now.
#
# Henry to agree next steps with Tom when he's back. Reminder here:
# https://jira.metaswitch.com/browse/DUIR-4934
