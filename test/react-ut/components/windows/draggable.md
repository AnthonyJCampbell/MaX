# Draggable Component unit testing explanation

We have not written any unit tests for `draggable.js` because it is impossible to do so at this point.

- The functionality of the component stems from the CSS property `-webkit-app-region: drag`. Since this is browser-window native behaviour, it is impossible for us to add automated testing for this.
